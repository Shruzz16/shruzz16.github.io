# Hero Section
name: Shrujal Zala
headline: Mechanical Core and Capacitance
description: >-
 M.S. Mechanical Engineering student with hands-on experience in structural and multiphysics simulation (FEA/CFD/COMSOL), CAD-driven design, and optimization. I focus on designing robust mechanical systems—from BIW/closures-oriented structures and product mechanisms to MEMS devices—taking concepts from simulation to prototype and test. Strong at connecting design intent, manufacturability, and performance to deliver high-quality, buildable solutions.
