description: 
<ul>
    <li>Developed and validated 3D steady, incompressible turbulent RANS CFD models for jet-driven mixing, buoyancy-driven stratification, and ventilation effectiveness (temperature gradients, velocity fields, ART).</li>
    <li>Implemented an IJV benchmark in ANSYS SpaceClaim (4.5 × 9 × 3.9 m; dual 0.3 × 0.3 m inlets at 0.3 m; 0.3 × 0.3 m ceiling outlet) with internal heat-source blocks.</li>
    <li>Solved continuity + Navier–Stokes + energy with buoyancy (Boussinesq, Tref ≈ 26 °C), RNG k–ε, SIMPLE coupling, and 2nd-order upwind schemes.</li>
    <li>Maintained near-wall fidelity via y⁺ (~90–180) and refined tetra mesh near inlets/outlets/walls/heat sources.</li>
    <li>Quantified stratification using ΔTₐ(z) and validated flow physics via velocity contour and jet development comparisons.</li>
