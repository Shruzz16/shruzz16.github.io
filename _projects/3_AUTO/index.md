title: Autobody Structure Design Case Studies | BIW & Closures-Focused Engineering
description: >-
  Three compact case studies focused on BIW/closures-adjacent structure design: (1) stamped motor-rail section optimization,
  (2) IC→BEV bending/torsion requirement shifts from mass redistribution, and (3) teardown-based BIW critique emphasizing load
  paths, joints, beads, and closure-ring robustness.

## Overview
A set of three **BIW + closures-relevant** case studies from **Fundamentals of Autobody Structure Design (ME/ISD 513)**, targeting the kind of thinking used in **Body Closures / BIW design** roles: **clear load paths, efficient sections, stable joints, and DFM-realistic geometry**.

---

## Case Study 1 — Motor-Compartment Rail Section Optimization (Stamped Thin-Wall)
**Goal:** Minimize mass per unit length while meeting axial + bending strength and an effective stiffness proxy, within packaging and stamping constraints.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**What I did (closures/BIW-relevant takeaways):**
- Designed a **two-part stamped section** constrained to an **80×160 mm** envelope, with flange/weld access rules and stamping limits (draft/radii/beads).:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Used **effective section behavior** (buckling/plate effectiveness) to drive geometry changes instead of “just adding thickness”.
- Applied **beads + local reinforcements** to suppress local buckling and recover effective Ixx without violating packaging.
- Kept the design **DFM-aware**: draft direction sanity, minimum radii, bead proportions, and weld stack/access constraints.

## Case Study 2 — IC → BEV Requirement Shift (Body Bending + Torsion Targets)
**Goal:** Quantify how **bending/torsion strength & stiffness requirements** change when converting an IC baseline to a **BEV** due to battery-driven mass redistribution.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**What I did (BIW targets + implications):**
- Built station-wise mass distributions and extracted **bending moment / torsion requirement** changes for IC vs BEV configurations.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Interpreted why BEVs typically push higher **global body** targets (bending + torsion) and what that means for **side frames / rings / underfloor shear paths**.
- Connected requirement changes to design levers: **section height**, **closed sections**, **shear-wall continuity**, and **joint efficiency** (critical for closures aperture stiffness and door opening robustness).

## Case Study 3 — BIW / Closures Design Critique (Caresoft “Iceberg” Teardown Method)
**Goal:** Apply structure-design principles to real vehicles using teardown photos/sections—evaluate **load paths, joints, beads, bulkheads, and ring structures**.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**What I did (closures-adjacent critique):**
- Performed a teardown-based assessment of **side-ring integrity** (A-/B-pillar, rocker, roof rail) and how well the structure supports **hinge + latch** load paths and aperture stiffness.
- Evaluated **joint quality** (layer stacks, fastener strategy, adhesive usage) and flagged efficiency risks like heavy multi-thickness stacks where applicable.
- Reviewed **bead strategy** on large panels (floor/firewall/underbody) for **shear buckling control** and NVH-friendly stiffness.
- Assessed **bridge/ring continuity** (crossmembers, dash/cowl links, underfloor members) for bending/torsion closure of the BIW “box”.

## Skills Used (Resume-friendly)
- BIW / Closures load-path reasoning (rings, bridges, grounded load paths)
- Thin-walled section efficiency (closed sections, tall webs, buckling-aware design)
- Stamping DFM constraints (draft, radii, beads, weld access)
- Requirement estimation mindset (IC→BEV bending/torsion target shifts)
- Joint/joining critique (spot-weld access/stacks, adhesive/rivet logic)
