title: Summer Internship 2023 | Design and Development of LED–Halogen Based Hybrid Solar Simulator | IIT Kanpur 
description: 
- Designed, prototyped, and validated a hybrid solar simulator for long-duration photothermal material testing under AM1.5G spectrum standards.  
- Achieved Class-A spectral match and spatial uniformity using ND filters, collimating lenses, and spectral balancing techniques.  
- Engineered integration of 100W phosphor-coated LED and dual 50W halogen lamps with multi-jet water cooling for stable thermal management.  
- Conducted system-level testing of photothermal fabrics, measuring evaporation rates, temperature profiles, and solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency.  
- Utilized pyranometers, thermocouples, and UV–VIS spectrometry for performance validation against ASTM E927 standards.
