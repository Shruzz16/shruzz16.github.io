title: Design Optimization of Driver Safety Parameters for an Obese Female Occupant in Toyota RAV4
description: 
- Performed Crash simulations using LS-DYNA and HPC resources, analyzed injury metrics and proposing safety design improvements
-  Optimized occupant safety systems by reducing HIC from 8.15% to 1.82% through restraint system improvements (seatbelts, airbags, steering column). 
- Improved crashworthiness using simulation-based analysis to address baseline issues and enhance occupant protection
