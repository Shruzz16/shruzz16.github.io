title: Hierarchical Porous Structures: Design and Analysis
description: • Designed and fabricated 3D copper porous structures with varying channel diameters. Conducted Microscopic Study using an Electronic Microscope to measure shrinkage percentages across green, pre-sintered, and sintered stages.
• Performed structure analysis of non-uniform porous copper structures using DragonFly software, extracting descriptors such as pore size, V/SA ratio, and volume.
• Validated software results through manual calculations and MATLAB, integrating experimental and computational methods for comprehensive structural characterization.
