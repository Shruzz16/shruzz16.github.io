  AUV Concept Design | SolidWorks Mechanical Design + Ideation Winner | Design Patent Awarded
description: >-
  Led the complete mechanical design of a non-defense Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) concept in SolidWorks. Cleared the
  ideation round, received a ₹50,000 cash prize, and secured a design patent. The design targets field-deployable underwater
  sensing and inspection use-cases such as environmental monitoring, mapping, and underwater maintenance.

## Overview
Designed the full **SolidWorks CAD** for a **non-defense AUV concept**, from concept ideation to a complete mechanical layout.
The project **cleared the ideation round**, won a **₹50,000 cash prize**, and resulted in a **design patent**.

## Purpose & application (non-defense)
- **Mapping + environmental monitoring:** packaging provisions for camera + water-quality sensing (e.g., temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen) for aquatic research and habitat health assessment.
- **Scientific research & exploration:** mechanical platform intended for autonomous data collection in environments that are difficult or unsafe for humans to access.
- **Underwater maintenance/cleaning (modular):** concept supports add-on attachments for debris removal / structure cleaning / submerged equipment maintenance in offshore, aquaculture, and infrastructure contexts.
- **Wireless underwater operation:** designed around the idea of wireless/acoustic communication for remote underwater operation and data collection.

## What I owned 
- End-to-end **mechanical concept development and CAD build** in **SolidWorks** (assembly structure, packaging, and design-for-integration).
- Mechanical provisions for integrating **camera + sensor modules** and mounting points for optional underwater task attachments.
