title: Stress Concentration and Fatigue Analysis of a VIVACE Converter
description:  Modeled the VIVACE Converter in SolidWorks and conducted detailed FEA to evaluate structural performance under dynamic marine conditions. Identified critical stress concentration areas and performed transient structural simulations in ANSYS to assess time-dependent stress response. Integrated OpenFOAM-generated hydrodynamic force data to conduct fatigue analysis, predicting long-term durability and system reliability under cyclic loading.
