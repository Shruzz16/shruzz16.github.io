  Research Assistant | Embedded High-Flow Microvalves for Untethered Inflatable Robots | FREE Lab (Functional Robotics for Every Environment)
description: >-
  Ongoing research in the FREE Lab (Functional Robotics for Every Environment) on embedded high-flow, high-pressure microvalves
  for untethered inflatable soft robots. Current work focuses on CAD-driven valve geometry development, rapid prototyping
  (3D printing), actuator integration, and benchtop validation toward high-bandwidth pneumatic actuation without external
  valve manifolds or long pneumatic tethers.
skills:
  - CAD (SolidWorks / Onshape)
  - Rapid Prototyping & 3D Printing
  - Pneumatic Valve Design (High-Flow / High-Pressure)
  - Actuator Integration (DC motor / SMA / Piezo / DEA-ready concepts)
  - Experimental Test & Iteration (Leak, flow, repeatability)

## Overview (Ongoing)
I am currently working as a **Research Assistant in the FREE Lab (Functional Robotics for Every Environment)** on the development of **embedded high-flow pneumatic microvalves** that enable **untethered inflatable soft robots** with faster actuation and reduced control latency.

---

## Why the valve matters (purpose + application)
- **Untethered inflatable robots** need rapid pneumatic power delivery without bulky external valve racks.
- Embedding valves directly into the robot structure reduces **line losses, dead volume, and delay**, enabling more dynamic behaviors for:
  - **search-and-rescue deployment**
  - **multi-terrain locomotion**
  - **shape-morphing appendages** (deploy/retract on demand)

## What I’m doing right now (CAD → prototype → test)
- **CAD & mechanism design:** parametric plate/orifice patterns, sealing interfaces, tolerancing, and packaging for embedment into inflatable structures.
- **Rapid prototyping:** iterative **3D-printed prototypes** for fit, motion, sealing behavior, and quick geometry changes.
- **Actuator integration (in progress):**
  - compact **direct-drive DC motor** options (low travel, repeatable positioning)
  - feasibility exploration for limited-travel actuators (**SMA / piezo / DEA-style concepts**) for ultra-compact integration
- **Benchtop validation (in progress):**
  - leak checks and seal iteration
  - qualitative/quantitative flow behavior comparison across design revisions
  - repeatability + mechanical robustness during repeated open/close cycles
